        <Text style={style.bodyText}>
          {' '}
          ⦁ Holdr+ is a digital identity wallet (“<Text style={style.bold}>Wallet</Text>”) designed to collect and store
          identity credentials (the “<Text style={style.bold}>Credentials</Text>”) issued by third-party service
          providers or government agencies (the “<Text style={style.bold}>Issuers</Text>”). Credentials can be verified
          by any third-party service provider or government agency (the “<Text style={style.bold}>Verifiers</Text>”) who
          are interoperable with Holdr+ as a Verifier. After an Issuer issues a Credential to your Wallet, you will have
          the option to accept or deny such credential within your Wallet. Credentials are stored locally on your device
          and will not be uploaded online or backed up by Indicio. You may remove your Credentials from your Wallet at
          any time.
        </Text>
        <Text style={style.bodyText}>
          {' '}
          ⦁ The App also allows Holdr+ users (“<Text style={style.bold}>Users</Text>”) to communicate and send private
          messages (“<Text style={style.bold}>Messages</Text>”) directly to other Users and Issuers they have connected
          with. The App encrypts your Messages before sending them and stores an encrypted copy on your mobile phone or
          desktop, which means that no one but you can see the message content stored on your device without your
          permission - not even us.
        </Text>
        <Text style={style.bodyText}>
          {' '}
          ⦁ Access to the App will, at all times, require an internet connection. In order to use the App, you must
          create a 6-digit PIN. All data, including your 6-digit PIN, messages, and Credentials, are stored locally on
          your device and not on any server held by the Company. You may be prompted by your device to accept or deny
          local data storage on such device. The App will ask for permission to use your device's camera for the sole
          purpose of scanning a QR code so that you can connect to an Issuer, Verifier, other Users. If you do not wish
          to grant access to your camera, you may not be able to use certain features of the App or download your
          Credentials.

        <Text style={style.bodyText}>
          {' '}
          ⦁ If your device is lost or destroyed, you forget your password, or you delete the App, you will no longer be
          able to access your Credentials. If you wish to reobtain such Credentials, you will need to go through the
          same process you went through to obtain the previous Credentials. Because the data is stored locally and is
          not backed up, we have no ability to facilitate recovery of your Credentials.

          ⦁ We do not charge any fees for using the Holdr+ App. The Hyperledger Indy blockchain on which the App runs on
          requires no gas fees. Issuers and Verifiers are unaffiliated with Indicio and may separately charge their own

          unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties
